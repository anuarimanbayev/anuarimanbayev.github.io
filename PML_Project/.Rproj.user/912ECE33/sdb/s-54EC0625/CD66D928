These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.  \n\nIn this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. \n\nIn this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants who performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.\n\n## Data Preprocessing  \n```{r preprocessing, cache = T}\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\n```\n### Download the Data\n```{r downloaddata, cache=T}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Anuar Imanbayev/Desktop/DataScienceCourse/DSC_Working_Directory/PML_Project\")\n\n# Training set\nif(!file.exists('pml-training.csv')) {\ndownload.file(url=\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\",\n        destfile=\"pml-training.csv\", method=\"libcurl\")\n}\n\n# Test set\nif(!file.exists('pml-testing.csv')) {\ndownload.file(url=\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\",\n    destfile=\"pml-testing.csv\", method=\"libcurl\")\n}\n```  \n### Read the Data\nAfter downloading the data from the data source, we read the two csv files into two data frames.  \n```{r readdata, cache = T}\ntrainRaw <- read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\", sep = \",\")\ntestRaw <- read.csv(\"pml-testing.csv\", sep = \",\")\ndim(trainRaw)\ndim(testRaw)\n```\nThe training data set contains 19622 observations and 160 variables.\nMeanwhile, the testing data set contains 20 observations and 160 variables.\nThe \"classe\" variable in the training set is the outcome to predict. \n\n### Clean the data\nIn this step, we clean the data and get rid of observations with missing values as well as some meaningless variables.\n```{r cleandata1, cache = T}\nsum(complete.cases(trainRaw))\n```\nFirst, we remove columns that contain NA missing values.\n```{r cleandata2, cache = T}\ntrainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] \ntestRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] \n```  \nNext, we get rid of some columns that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.\n```{r cleandata3, cache = T}\nclasse <- trainRaw$classe\ntrainRemove <- grepl(\"^X|timestamp|window\", names(trainRaw))\ntrainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]\ntrainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]\ntrainCleaned$classe <- classe\ntestRemove <- grepl(\"^X|timestamp|window\", names(testRaw))\ntestRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]\ntestCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]\n```\nNow, the cleaned training data set contains 19622 observations and 53 variables.\nMeanwhile, the testing data set contains 20 observations and 53 variables. \nThe \"classe\" variable is still in the cleaned training set.\n\n### Slice the data\nThen, we split the cleaned training set into a training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps.  \n```{r slicedata, cache = T}\nset.seed(16567) # For reproducibility purposes\ninTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)\ntrainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]\ntestData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]\n```\n\n## Data Modeling\nWe fit a predictive model for activity recognition using **Random Forest** algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general. We use **6-fold cross validation** when applying the algorithm. K at 6 is neither too large nor too small for this dataset to maintain balance in bias and variance.\n```{r datamodeling1, cache = T}\ncontrolRf <- trainControl(method=\"cv\", 6)\nmodelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method=\"rf\", trControl=controlRf, ntree=300)\nmodelRf\n```\nThen, we estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.  \n```{r datamodeling2, cache = T}\npredictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)\nconfusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)\n```\n```{r datamodeling3, cache = T}\naccuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)\naccuracy\noose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])\noose\n```\nSo, the estimated accuracy of the model is 99.27% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.73%. \n\n## Predicting for Test Data Set\nNow, we apply the model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the `problem_id` column first.  \n```{r testdatapredicting, cache = T}\nresult <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])\nresult\n```  \n\n## Appendix: Figures\n1. Correlation Matrix Visualization  \n```{r figure1, cache = T}\ncorrPlot <- cor(trainData[, -length(names(trainData))])\ncorrplot(corrPlot, method=\"color\")\n```\n2.
